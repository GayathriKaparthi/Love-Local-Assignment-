ALGORITHM:

1) Input from  user to get number of rows
2) Declaring ana empty list to store the values
3) Using for loop which iterates through 0 to n-1
4) Creating a new row by appending a list of '1's of length 'row+1'
5) For each new row update the values based on the previous row's elements sum
6) By using formula row[j]=triangle[i-1][j-1]+triangle[i-1][j]
7) Return the generated pascals triangle as a list of lists

LOGIC:

triangle=[]  //empty list
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row=[1]*(i+1) //appending 1 to the rows
        if i>=2:
            for j in range(1,i):
                row[j]=triangle[i-1][j-1]+triangle[i-1][j] //add the elements of previous row if len(row)>2
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle
